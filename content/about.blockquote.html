<pre>Assemble (bilingual) web pages from HTML fragments.

Based on three main concepts:
* Context
* "expressions"
* Interpreter

The Context is a dictionary of HTML fragments (indexed by strings) with fallback ("parent") Context. The HTML fragments may contain "expressions" enclosed in section (§sec()§) symbols, e.g., §sec()§bla(blubb, foo(bar))§sec()§. Operations (such as "bla" and "foo") are translated into method calls on the Interpreter, i.e., interpreter.bla(context, "blubb", interpreter.foo(context, "bar")). In addition to HTML fragments, the context can also store the current language, the name of the current page, etc.

I recommend partitioning any HTML page into the following fragments:
* the scaffolding -- here called page_de and page_en --, with variables for title, description, actual content, navigation bars, and scripts;
* the content -- here called main;
* scripts -- here called script;
* navigation bars.

The content (and maybe some scripts) is the only fragment that is really unique to each page.

The navigation bars can easily be computed using a few auxiliary fragments:
* the scaffolding -- here called nav_skeleton;
* selected entry -- here called nav_active;
* normal entry -- here called nav_normal.

Everything that is unqiue to a page is recorded in a file called pages.json. Moreover, there are files dict_en.json and dict_de.json that provide English and German names for some variables (currently: month names).
